[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/3b2ac103-e6e2-4d8f-bbc4-b2863172a6a1/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/confident-neumann-d9dc3a/deploys)

AE-Instalinks is a Netlify CMS site built with React and Gatsby. Login to the backend [here](http://instalinks.agentelite.com)

It is a static site so when changes are made in the backend and published it will take a few minutes for the site to be built/published

Currently when making changes in the the links backend adding a new link causes the preview to break. If the preview is toggles off then on with the "eye" icon it will work again.
